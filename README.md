wp-auto-more-tag
================

Multibyte enabled version of the Wordpress plugin "Auto More Tag"

When using the original plugin from: http://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-more-tag/
with international sites that use foreign UTF-8 characters, we encountered some
strange behaviour (e.g. post content cut off after special characters on save).

This is plugin is a modified version of the original plugin, that is made aware
of multibyte strings and does not show the erroneous behaviour anymore.

See readme.txt for more information on the plugin itself.
