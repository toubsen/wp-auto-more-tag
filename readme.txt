== Description ==

Auto More Tags is a WordPress plugin that allows you to forget placing a more
tag on every post. It lets you stop worrying about where you should place those
tags, and just set rules. Once those rules are set, the intelligent placing
system will use your settings as a guideline, and attempt to place the more tag
as closely to your settings as possible, without breaking formatting or cutting
paragraphs off without cause.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the auto-more-tags.zip to your /wp-content/plugins directory
2. Extract the files
3. Modify the settings, or rely on the default settings.
